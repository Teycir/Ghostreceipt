# Task Plan: Provider Cascade & API Error Handling Corrections

- [x] Add chain-aware transaction hash validation at request schema boundary.
- [x] Fix cascade error normalization/mapping to be case-insensitive and consistent.
- [x] Implement configured retry behavior (`maxRetries`, `retryDelayMs`) in `ProviderCascade`.
- [x] Improve `NOT_FOUND` cascade behavior to avoid premature stop on first provider.
- [x] Add timeout cancellation plumbing with `AbortSignal` support in providers where available.
- [x] Add unit tests in `tests/` for cascade classification/failover/retry behavior.
- [x] Add route-level tests for invalid hash and error code/status mapping.
- [x] Run targeted tests and summarize results.

## Review
- `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm test -- tests/unit/providers/cascade.test.ts tests/unit/api/fetch-tx-route.test.ts` passes (7 tests).
- Jest reported two pre-existing config warnings: `coverageThresholds` should be `coverageThreshold`.

# Task Plan: Documentation Organization Cleanup

- [x] Create a central docs index in `docs/README.md`.
- [x] Move strategy/progress docs from repo root into `docs/project/`.
- [x] Move runbook-style docs into `docs/runbooks/`.
- [x] Update all internal references to new document paths.
- [x] Add a short archive note for old planning docs.
- [x] Verify references with repo-wide path scan.

## Review
- Docs are consolidated under `docs/` with `project/` and `runbooks/` groupings.
- Main entry points updated: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `agents.md`.
- Verified with `rg` scan that old root doc links are removed from active references.

# Task Plan: Review Follow-up Fixes

- [x] Preserve structured provider errors from cascade all-failure path.
- [x] Add real abort propagation for Ethereum public RPC provider calls.
- [x] Return HTTP 400 for malformed JSON request bodies in oracle route.
- [x] Fix Jest coverage threshold config key so CI enforces thresholds.
- [x] Add tests for preserved provider error and malformed JSON handling.
- [x] Run typecheck and targeted tests, then record results.

## Review
- `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm test -- tests/unit/providers/cascade.test.ts tests/unit/api/fetch-tx-route.test.ts` passes (10 tests).
- Jest coverage key typo fixed (`coverageThreshold`), and the previous config warning is gone.

# Task Plan: CI/CD Hardening

- [x] Tighten workflow security controls (permissions, concurrency, timeout).
- [x] Pin CI Node runtime to `.nvmrc` for env parity.
- [x] Run secret scan via maintained script as an early gate.
- [x] Add dependency-review gate for pull requests.
- [x] Harden secret scan scope to include docs/workflows.
- [x] Validate lint/typecheck/tests/build and summarize results.

## Review
- `npm run check:secrets` passes.
- `npm run lint` passes.
- `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm run test:coverage -- --ci --runInBand` passes with enforced thresholds.
- `npm run build` passes (required unsandboxed execution locally due Turbopack process restrictions).
- Next.js config warnings are removed (`typedRoutes` moved to top-level and config renamed to `next.config.mjs`).

# Task Plan: Verify & Sharing Integrity Fixes

- [x] Ensure verifier displays claims derived from verified proof signals, not URL metadata.
- [x] Reduce and stabilize share-link payload encoding.
- [x] Add user-facing QR generation error state.
- [x] Handle clipboard paste failures without unhandled promise rejections.
- [x] Add unit tests for proof export/import compatibility and claim extraction from public signals.
- [x] Run typecheck and targeted tests, then summarize.

## Review
- Verifier now only consumes `proof` from URL and derives displayed claims from verified `publicSignals`.
- Proof share payload export/import uses URL-safe base64url with backward-compatible JSON import support.
- Receipt QR generation now exposes a user-facing fallback error while preserving copy-link flow.
- Clipboard paste flow now handles denied/failed reads without surfacing unhandled promise rejections.
- Added unit tests: `tests/unit/zk/prover.test.ts` and `tests/unit/zk/share.test.ts`.
- `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm test -- tests/unit/zk/prover.test.ts tests/unit/zk/share.test.ts tests/unit/api/fetch-tx-route.test.ts tests/unit/providers/cascade.test.ts tests/unit/zk/witness.test.ts` passes (26 tests).

# Task Plan: Gitignore Hygiene

- [x] Audit current `.gitignore` entries against actual local/generated files.
- [x] Add missing ignore rules for local tool state directories.
- [x] Remove ignore rules that conflict with intentionally tracked files.

## Review
- Added ignores for `/.history/`, `.swc/`, and `.amazonq/`.
- Removed ignores for `package-lock.json` and `next-env.d.ts` to match tracked-file intent.
